Starting on 01-01-2016, I decided to run at least one mile a day every day for the rest of my life. 

And I keep a record here, as a method to keep myself motivated. I also write short blog posts weekly in Chinese to refect on my running. [->Link to all my posts<-](https://www.jianshu.com/nb/2906146).

See my running records below:

My inspiration came from the [United States Running Streak Association, Inc.][1], although I am not a member but the Association are full of people who keep running part of their daily routine.
